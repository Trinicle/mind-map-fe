MindMap is a web platform that helps users turn messy meeting transcripts into structured insights. After signing up and uploading a transcript, users are presented with an interactive topic graph that breaks down the conversation into organized topics and subtopics. Powered by AI, the system extracts key points, suggests relevant follow-up questions, surfaces answers, and highlights linked documents or resources—all visually mapped in a branching interface. It’s designed to make meetings easier to review, search, and act on.
